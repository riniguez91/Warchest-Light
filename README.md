# Warchest-Lite-Eventbrite
## Overview of the game

Warchest is a game about controlling zones and making strategies, just like Chess or Sh≈çgi. The game is played with a 9x9 board, but in order to make things simpler the current implementation will have a 5x5 board with 4 types of pieces and the goal of the game is to have 4 controlled zones before the opponent.
